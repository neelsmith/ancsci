##Subject matter and approach of this course ##

In the words of Thomas  Kuhn:

> Every civilization of which we have records has possessed a technology, an art, a religion, a political system, laws, and so on …  But only the civilizations that descend from Hellenic Greece have possessed more than the most rudimentary science

We  focus primarily on three important moments in the development of ancient science, with special emphasis on three key individuals whose work has been preserved for us to study directly.

1. the early Hellenistic period, ca. 300 B.C., represented by the work of Euclid
2. the later third century B.C., as known from the  work of Archimedes
3. Greek science in the Roman empire, as seen in the work of Claudius Ptolemy (second century A.D.)

We will consider questions about the goals, methods and subject matter of ancient science, and how science relates to the broader social, religious and intellectual context of the ancient world (as outlined in the [course guide][guide]).

Throughout the course, we will work from primary sources, and will emphasize how we can adapt our approaches to these questions to the limitations of surviving source material.  

## Assignments ##

Reading and assignments are posted on the course schedule.  Class preparation regularly includes questions you should think about prior to coming to class; sometimes it includes instructions to prepare material to submit  in class.  Occasionally, we will have short (5-10 minute) quizzes in class.  Regular class preparation, in-class performance and quizzes count for 15% of your final grade.  We will also have one  one mid-term exam on @hrexam@, worth 20% of course grade.

In addition to these requirements, you will work on a series of  original research problems. Students (and even faculty) often mistakenly assume that original historical discoveries can only be made by individuals who have studied ancient history for years.  This is false.  Many important historical problems are most effectively addressed by collaborating teams that may include complete newcomers to ancient history.  

For each of the problem sets, you will work in groups of 2-4 students.  For each topic, you will begin by collecting data or historical observations, and recording your work in a structured form so that we can then readily pool all our observations together as a class.  We will publish the resulting scholarly datasets on the internet in open data formats that support reuse and further development by other scholars: like all good research, your work will become a starting point for further research.

The topics will give you hands-on experience with a great variety of evidence and approaches to the study of ancient science. Topics are described in [fuller detail in the specific instructions for each project][problemsets], but, in brief, they are:

[problemsets]:  problemsets.html


1. **Measuring the circumference of the earth**.  In this exercise in experimental history, we will recreate an experiment by the famous scientist Eratosthenes, and attempt to replicate his method for measuring the circumference of the earth. This will help us to read the accounts of Eratosthenes' experiment with a better understanding of the use and limits of ancient scientific instruments.
2. **Interpreting the largest data set of ancient science**.  We will work with a digital edition of Claudius Ptolemy's database of more than 6,000 points with longitude-latitude coordinates to try to understand how he could have compiled and worked with this globe-spanning data set.
3. **Contributing to the edition of unpublished manuscripts**.  We will work with high-resolution digital photography of two manuscripts in Leiden (Netherlands) with works of Claudius Ptolemy.  While known to scholars, neither manuscript has been thoroughly published.  We will work on sections with maps or tables of numeric data, and see how our readings compare with printed editions of these works.

You will either individually or in a small group on a project for the end of the semester that will give you the opportunity to purse one of these topics in more depth, and develop one aspect of one of your assignments in more detail.    You will meet with your instructor during the course of the semester to define a prepared question, which will be assigned to you no later than @meetme@, and will be submitted at the end study period.
