# Take-home question for final exam #

One major essay for the course final exam on @finalexam@ will be a take home exam.

Each student should sign up for an appointment where we will select a topic for your take-home question, using [the form you were previously emailed][doodle].

Take-home questions allow you to go into more depth on a topic we have looked at.  The only absolute requirement for your question is that your topic reflect the basic work of a historian: to come to independent conclusions based on primary evidence.  Topics that merely summarize or report on others' work will not be accepted.

One option is to extend individually the work you did on any one of your four group research projects.  Here are some examples of questions you could work on, derived from those projects:

## The language of Greek science ##

We looked at these questions in class:

> What range of meaning did the verbal adjectives cover? Do the ideas Aristotle expresses with the verbal adjective relate to the logical methods we must follow in a structured argument?

Address those questions for the *entire* extent of one treatise of Aristotle or of Claudius Ptolemy.

## Replicating Eratosthenes' experiment ##

We experimented with observation using a gnomon.  Some possible extensions of your experience could include:

- using one of the DYI guides you can find on the internet or in James Evans' text, draw the guidelines of a sundial for the latitude of Worcester, MA.  Observe shadow plots on multiple days against the sundial's predicted shadow lines.  Based on your observations, discuss what kind of limits astronomers working with gnomons faced, and how you might attempt to minimize the errors or imprecision in your observation.


## Interpreting the diagrams in the Archimedes palimpsest ##

Each group looked closely at one figure from Archimedes *Floating Bodies, Book1*.  Extend this work by considering a group of diagrams from the manuscript (e.g., at least the first six figures from *Floating Bodies* 1, or the legible diagrams from the *Method*).  Do they form a coherent series, with consistent labeling and visual conventions, or should we understand them as a collection of figures designed ad hoc to accompany each individual proposition?


## Antiquity's largest data set ##

We collected data that will allow us to compare Ptolemy's values for longitude-latitude locations with modern data.  There are many possible questions we could ask, either based on the Ptolemaic data set alone, or based on comparison of Ptolemy's data with the modern archaeological gazetteer.  Here are a few examples:

- Looking at Ptolemy's raw data, what degree of precision does he claim in longitude and what precision in latitude for different provinces?  Is this correlated with the spatial density of the data points in that province?
- Looking at Ptolemy's data in relation to the modern archaeological gazetteer, where do the two data sets tend to overlap, and where do the inventories in the two data sets differ?  Can we explain these differences in relation either to how Ptolemy generated his data set, or how our archaeological gazetteer was assembled?
- If you are interested in map projections, consider the problem we discussed in class, that Ptolemy apparently computes his latitude values from a baseline running through Rhodes (at 36 degrees N), but believes that the baseline passes through Rhodes, Sicily and the Pillars of Heracles (Straits of Gibraltar).  If we "un-deform" his baseline, can we bring Italy into a more accurate NW-SE geographic orientation?

## Other possible topics ##

You may propose other topics so long as they meet the criteria that you arrive at independent conclusions from consideration of primary evidence.  A few examples:

- In several of his treatises, Claudius Ptolemy describes in detail how to construct scientific instruments (perhaps most notably in the *Almagest* and in his musical treatises).  Can you construct and use one of his machines?
- Ptolemy's *Geography* includes descriptions of how to generate both world maps and regional maps to visualize the inhabited world.  Can you use his data set to produce your own Ptolemaic maps?
