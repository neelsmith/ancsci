# Questions to consider for the hour exam on @hrexam@#


- How have texts about ancient science been transmitted to us? Specifically, what does the transmission of Euclid's *Phaenomena* suggest about how we have come to have the text you are reading in the translation of Berggren and Thomas?
- In the two-sphere model of the cosmos, recognize on the celestial sphere the ecliptic circle (a great circle), and the three parallel circles of the Tropic of Cancer, the Tropic of Capricorn and the Equator (also a great circle), and understand their relation to each other.
- How were the arctic and antarctic circles defined in Greek astronomy? What other terms can Euclid use to refer to these circles on the celestial sphere?
- How completely does the formal structure of Euclid's *Elements of Geometry*, as analyzed by Proclus, apply to the *Phaenomena*?
- What is the relation between text and diagrams in Euclid's formal scientific writing? What kinds of observations inform us about their relation?
- Be able to give one example of a pattern in the Greek language of scientific writers like Euclid that cannot be reliably recognized from reading in English translation.
- In what ways does Eratosthenes' experiment to measure the circumference of the earth differ from the science we see in Euclid's *Phaenomena*? What is the approximate date of each scholar's work?



 
<!--
- Be familiar with the main contents of propositions 1-8 of Euclid's *Phaenomena* (including understanding Euclid's use of the technical terms "syzygy" and "zodiac circle"). In what ways does proposition 8 represent a major conclusion of early Hellenistic astronomy?
- 
For propositions 6 and 8, be able to interpret the diagrams derived from manuscripts and printed in the translation of Berggren and Thomas.
