# Final project #

For the required final project, you may work either individually or in small groups.


## Topic ##

Your project should respond to **one** question that you can address thoroughly, by working directly
with primary sources.  You must choose an appropriate method
for answering your question, based on the source material available
to us.  This might involve a close study of textual sources,
a study of ancient scientific data sets such as the geographic
data in Ptolemy's *Geography*, or
an experimental recreation of ancient scientific practices.

## Timeline

- By Nov. 5, meet for initial discussion
- By noon, Nov. 15, submit written proposal of topic.   Your proposal should answer three questions  as specifically as possible:
    - what is the question you plan to address?
    - how do you plan to answer you question? what method or procedure do you plan to follow?
    - what  source material do you plan to begin working with?
- By noon, Dec. 15, submit final project.

You may meet with me at any time to discuss your project, or to look at drafts or in-progress work.
