## Model

---

demonstration/persuasion vs. discovery

*apodeiknumi* is demonstration/persuasion



---

Preliminaries (*hypotheses*): we agree on basics about world

(And our reasoning goes on from there)

---

Where do hyptheses come from?

Intuitions or inferences from experience/observation?  (Not proven b/c not possible to prove?)

The daily rotation of the kosmos
The annual motion of the sun
The horizon and arctic circles
Prior points ("hypotheses") assumed by all Greek astronomy
the earth is a sphere
the earth is lies at the center of the kosmos
the earth is of negligible size compared to the size of the kosmos
the cosmos, too, is spherical
the kosmos revolves about an axis through its center (which is also the center of the earth!)
Some features of this model
generalized laws: "all objects tend toward the center of the universe"; "[eternal] heavenly bodies move at a uniform speed"
specific observations provide evidence for testing hypotheses (e.g., the observed motion of the "fixed" stars supports the idea of the rotation of the celestial sphere)
interest in describing and modelling generalized laws mathematically (especially using geometric methods): e.g., "all [eternal] motion is circular"
