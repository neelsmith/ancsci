# Context


   1. Observation (before light pollution)
   2. Explanation
   3. Model

## *Phaenomena*




>"**the things that appear**"


- regular, observable patterns
- explanation and model:
    - geometric mechanism
    - cause?

## Model works at multiple scales simultaneously

Genius of Greek astro model:  the horizon and arctic circles

## Prior points ("hypotheses")

Assumed by all Greek astronomy:

- the earth is a sphere
- the earth is lies at the center of the kosmos
- the earth is of negligible size compared to the size of the kosmos
- the kosmos, too, is spherical
- the kosmos revolves about an axis through its center (which is also the center of the earth!)

# Some features of this model

- **generalized laws**: "all objects tend toward the center of the universe"; "[eternal] heavenly bodies move at a uniform speed"
- specific observations provide evidence for testing hypotheses (e.g., the observed motion of the "fixed" stars supports the idea of the rotation of the celestial sphere)
- model can be analyzed mathematically (especially using geometric methods)

---

## Preferences in explanation

- simplicity (jcircles)
- symmetry

# Historical context


---

## Earliest Greek scientific texts

ca. 300 BCE:

- Euclid, *Phaenomena*
- Autolycus of Pitane

---


## Questions to ask about any text

- who wrote it?
- when was it written?
- who was the audience?
- what was the author's purpose?

Compares science to lawcourt
