## HIST OF TEXT ##


Gregory 1703 only Greek text before Menge 1916

Knew only texts descended from Vat.gr. 204

Heiberg finds evidence in new MS (**not** of same family: Vind.gr.31.13)

Menge edition:  families *a* (new group) and *b* (Vat.gr.204)

What distinguishes?

- additional/alternative proofs in *b*
- in *a*, scholia separate from text
- proofs in each cannot be explained in terms of copying of other? (Heiberg)

In any case:  expanded explanation in *b*

Props. lacking in *a* group
