## Traditional *stemmatic analysis* ##

- family tree model
- assumptions:  differences in MSS ~ errors in copying


---

## Example: Euclid, *Phaenomena* ##

- Gregory edition, 1703:  all mss similar to Vatican Gr. 204
- Menge edition, 1916:  two distinct families

---

## Families of Euclid MSS ##

Family **a** (fewer copies):  

- *scholia* (scholarly notes) separate from text
- all MSS in family break off midway through Prop. 16



Family **b** (more numerous):

- alternate proofs and fuller proofs included 
- includes text through Propisition 18

---

## Euclid read by earlier authors ##


- Pappus of Alexandria (4th c AD):  discusses text lacking proofs found in both **a** and **b**!
- *Phaenomena* found together with other short works:  "the Little Astronomy"
