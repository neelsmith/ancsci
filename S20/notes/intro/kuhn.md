## Kuhn

Popular narrative: science == progressjj

- emphasis on *knowledge* and its growth


Kuhn, *Structure of Scientific Revolution*

Scientific practice is

- the practice of a *community*
- ... with shared assumptions
- ... that define problems

Progress is not linear (revolutionary)

Emphasis on who, how, why? Historicizing, more nuanced explanation
