Refer to the attached figure illustrating a shadow plot taken in the northern hemisphere (like






Massachusetts, or Greece) at three (or four) dates in the year.  


The diagram shows the location of the gnomon at the small black box labelled “G”.

For the summer solstice, the two equinoxes, and the winter solstice, it shows the path of shadows divided into astronomical hours (1/12 of the day light hours).

The diagram also shows the height of the gnomon used to create the three shadow plots.

Draw an arrow on the diagram showing true (polar) north.

Then sketch below how you could geometrically find the height of the sun at noon on the equinox.
