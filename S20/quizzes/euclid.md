## Quiz: Euclidean proof


### *Hypotheses* in Greek proof

For each of the following passages from book 1 of Euclid's *Elements of Geometry*, indicate what category of *hypothesis* it expresses:

**A**:


>  It is possible to extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.


**B**:


> A point is infinitely small.


### Formal proof

The text below gives an English translation of Euclid, proposition 1.1.

**A**.  What kind of proposition is it?


Identify which numbered statement or statements make up each of the following parts of the proposition:


**B**:  the statement (or enunciation)

**C**:  the conclusion

**D**: the proof (or demonstration:  *apodeixis* in Greek)

**E**: a step in the proof that relies on a common notion (or *axiom*)

**Euclid 1.1**

(0) Given a straight line, construct an equilateral triangle on it.

(1) Assume we have a finite straight line; label it AB. We want to construct an equilateral triangle on AB.

(2) Using A as the center, and AB as the distance from the center , construct a circle; label two further points on the circle C and D.

(3) Using B as the center, and BA as the distance from the center, construct a circle; label a further point on the circle E, and label as C the point where the two circles cut one another.

(4) Connect C and A with a straight line; connect C and B with a straight line.


(5) Since A is the center of circle CDB, AC must be equal to AB.

(6) Since B is the center of CAE, BC must be equal to BA.

(7) But we proved that CA is equal to AB, so CA and CB are both equal to AB; and two things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.

(8) Therefore, the three straight lines CA, AB, BC are equal to one another; therefore, the triangle ABC is equilateral.

(9) This is what we set out to construct. (Q.E.F.)
