## Announcements and news

Holy Cross courses enter a distance-learning phase the week of Mar. 23-27.  Detailed course plans will be posted here on Monday, Mar. 23.

##  Optional check in

I'll hold a brief, optional Google Meet on **Thursday, Mar. 19, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time**.  If you'd like to take part, we can take a few minutes just to make contact again (as well as test out using Google Meet).

I'll present a few ideas from your Google Form surveys about things we could do. You can bring further suggestions if you have additional ideas.
