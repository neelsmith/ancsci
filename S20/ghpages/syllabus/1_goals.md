## Course goals and objectives

This course will explore different approaches to studying the past, using different kinds of sources.  We will stress traditional close reading of primary source material, with attention to how we can contextualize our reading of sources in translation without imposing anachronistic assumptions.  Our approach, for example, will *not* from a modern definition of "science," and then look for evidence of it in the Greco-Roman world.  Instead, we will explore what the concept of *epistêmê* (one term often translated as "science") includes.

We will replicate ancient scientists' observations and working procedures  to understand better the practical aspects of ancient scientific practice.

Through study and editing of sections of medieval manuscripts, we will gain insight into how ancient scientific work has been transmitted to today.
