## Course description

What are the goals, methods and subject matter of science? How does science relate to the broader social, religious and intellectual context of the ancient world? More specifically, we shall consider: the relation of science to mathematics, the relation of science to technology, the role of experiment in ancient science. Course assignments will include hands-on reconstructions of ancient experiments, and experience reading diagrams and texts from manuscripts of ancient scientific texts.
