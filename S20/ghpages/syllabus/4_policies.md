## Academic integrity

You should be familiar with the college's policy on academic integrity:  <https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#academicintegritytext>  Much of our classwork will be collaborative.  You are expected to take part fully on all parts of collaborative assignments.

If you have any questions or are uncertain how it applies to our course, please speak to me.

## Diversity and inclusion

Studying the ancient Mediterrean world at Holy Cross is one way to challenge a centuries-long tradition that reserved that study for a privileged elite. The challenge goes beyond simply welcoming students however they identify their race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, religious or spiritual tradition, or socioeconomic background. As we work to understand the multicultural world of the ancient Mediterranean, we reflect on and actively explore how this can help us recognize and respond to structures of power and privilege in our own lives.

This work is especially important today, when historically false images of the ancient world are being invoked to support particular political viewpoints. Studying Classics helps us see through erroneous assertions about the “whiteness” of the ancient Mediterranean, and reject claims that the Greco-Roman world is the special province of any ethnic or political group.


## Academic accommodations

All academic accommodations need to be approved through the Office of Accessibility Services, in accordance with the college's policy on requests for reasonable accommodation: <https://catalog.holycross.edu/requirements-policies/academic-policies/#coursepoliciestext>

If you are already registered with Accessibility Services, please let me know.

If you feel the need for accommodation based on the impact of a disability, you should contact the Office of Accessibility Services to discuss support services available.

Once the office receives documentation supporting the request for accommodation, you would meet privately with Accessibility Services to discuss reasonable and appropriate accommodations. You can reach the office by calling 508-793-3693 or by visiting Hogan Campus Center, room 505.

## Confidentiality and mandatory reporting.

All instructors are mandatory reporters. This means that while I will keep any information you share about your life experiences in classroom discussions, written work, one-on-one meetings private whenever legally possible, I am required to share any information you disclose about sexual misconduct, a prior suicide attempt or an intention to attempt suicide.

I am expected to share information about sexual misconduct with the College’s Office of Title IX Initiatives. You can also get in touch with Title IX directly at 508-793-3336 or titleix@holycross.edu. For more information, please visit https://www.holycross.edu/sexual-respect-and-title-ix. If you would like to discuss the matter confidentially, the following confidential resources are available to you: the Chaplains’ Office, 508-793-2448; Counseling Center, 508-793-3363; Health Services, 508-793-2276.

Following the College’s Suicide Protocol, if you disclose a prior suicide attempt or an intention or plan to attempt suicide, I will share that information with the Chair of our student CARE Team, who will engage in appropriate outreach.
