## Course requirements and grading

Course grades will be determined by specification grading, an assessment system in which assignments are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale according to a previously circulated rubric.  One aim of specification grading is to give you control over your grades. Grades are not arbitrarily assigned â€“ they are earned by the work that you do. Further, you get to decide how much time and energy you want to commit to the course in order to achieve the grade you desire.


### Grade specifications

Course grades will be determined by your completion of course requirements in the following categories:

- group lab projects (total of 3)
- individual quizzes in class (total of 7)
- individual or group development of a course data set (total of 3 options)
- individual or group self-defined project, including possible oral presentation to the class

## Class attendance

Class attendance is required. You will not be penalized for a single unexcused absence, but beginning with the second unexcused absence,  your course grade will be lowered by 1/3 of a letter grade for each unexcused absence.  (There is no penatly for excused absences.)
