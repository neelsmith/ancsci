## Course requirements and grading

Course grades will be determined by specification grading, an assessment system in which assignments are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale according to a previously circulated rubric.  One aim of specification grading is to give you control over your grades. Grades are not arbitrarily assigned â€“ they are earned by the work that you do. Further, you get to decide how much time and energy you want to commit to the course in order to achieve the grade you desire.


## Prior course work

All students have successfully completed all course requirements for the first part of the course.


## Individual summary conference

Each of you must meet with me briefly for an individual conference sometime during the week of April 20-24.  This may be by Zoom, phone, text message or other real-time medium.  **This conference is required to pass the course.**

## Graded assignments

Course grades will be determined by your satisfactory completion of the following course requirements in part 2 of the course (from March 24 to April 30):


- quizzes and worksheets (total of **4**)
- group projects:
    -  group Ptolemy project
        - compile data set
        - analyze data compilation
    -  edition of assigned section of a manuscript of Ptolemy
        - edit manuscript
        - analyze edition    
- individual or group self-defined project

## Participation in Zoom meetings

Most weeks, we will have a brief group meeting using Zoom.  A major goal of these meets is to make sure we stay in touch, and I know that you're OK while we're scattered in different locations.  If you know ahead of time that it is not possible for you to take part, please let me know by email.  If you are unexpectedly unable to take part, please follow up with me by email.
