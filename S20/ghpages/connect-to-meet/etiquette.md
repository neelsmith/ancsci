- mute your mic before entering the Meet.
- keep the chat stream open.  You can ask questions here, and follow other people who may not have access to audio.
- if possible, use headphones or ear buds when speaking.  This will cut down on audio feedback.

I'll moderate our class Meets.  If you ask a question in the chat stream, I'll try to recognize it.  I may ask you to turn on your mic, if you have one, and comment via audio.

I'll get things wrong (more than usual, that is).  Thanks in advance for your patience and for helping each other out.
