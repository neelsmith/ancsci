## Context

Review from last class questions that we ask about every text we read.  Use Google to find out when Claudius Ptolemy lived, where he lived and worked, and what other works he wrote besides the essay you will read for today's class, *On the Criterion*.


## Before coming to class

Ptolemy's short essay, *On the Criterion*, is a unique text:  a philosophical statement by one of antiquity's greatest scientists about his understanding of how we gain true knowledge of the world. The expression "the criterion of truth" was a traditional one in philosophy, but Ptolemy does not explore every traditional question associated with the topic.  His aim, as one of the editors of the translation you will read puts it, was to present an 'epistemology for the working scientist.'

Read the English translation of Ptolemy, *On the Criterion* (pdf available on Moodle).

As you learned in class, Ptolemy compares science to "the law court," but the legal institutions he refers are those of classical Athens (fifth century BCE).

- Compare Ptolemy's time and place of writing with the time and place of the law court
-  How does the example of a law court help us understand the balance of  reason and sense perception in science?
