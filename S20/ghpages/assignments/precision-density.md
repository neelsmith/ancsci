layout: page
---

Our class workshop today will focus on the second of the three group submissions for part 2 of the course:  evaluating the relation between [density and precision in the geographic coordinates of Ptolemy's *Geography*](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/science/S20/labs/ptolemy-geo/precision/).

In this workshop, we will:

- troubleshoot any problems your team has run into
- discuss ways you could expand this assignment into an [end-of-term project](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/science/S20/projects/)
- illustrate ways you could use a freely available geographic information system, [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), to analyze Ptolemy's data spatially
