title: "Antiquity's largest data set"

## Background

We will work with a data set extracted from the text of Claudius Ptolemy's *Geography*, consisting of more than 6,000 points identified by several properties (continent, political unit, cultural/ethnic group, geographic region, and type of location), and located with coordinates expressed in longitude and latitude.  How was it possible for Ptolemy to compile this data set?  What can it tell us about scientific knowledge of the world in Ptolemy's day, and about the aims and methods of the scientific discipline of geography?




## Before coming to class

On Moodle, please read Berggren and Jones, "Introduction to Ptolemy's *Geography*"

Some of Berggren and Jones' introduction will already be familiar to you.  Be sure you understand how Ptolemy's units of longitude and latitude work.

What kinds of observations could Ptolemy have drawn on to produce his database of longitude/latitude locations?  Following up on  our discussion of precision and accuracy, what inferences can we make about the precision and accuracy of Ptolemy's data aset?
