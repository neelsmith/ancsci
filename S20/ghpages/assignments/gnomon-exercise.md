1. You may use any upright object to cast a shadow:  keep in mind that you want a right angle between the upright and the level surface you are recording the shadow plot on.
1. In picking a location for your shadow plot,  try to find a spot, indoors or outdoors, with good exposure to the sun throughout the day.  Remember that
your shadows will be much longer from east-west than north-south, so try to find a spot where you can set the longer side of your paper running roughly east-west.
1. Set up a sheet to record your observations on a level surface. Set up an upright pointer, and label the point "gnomon" on your recording sheet. How can you guarantee that the pointer is upright and your recording surface level?
1. Prepare to record your data.    You should note your names, the date, and a brief indication of where you set up your recording board.  (If possible, you may want to mark out your spot with masking tape or otherwise so that you can replicate your observations later.)   Be **sure** to record the height of the gnomon by drawing a straight line on a blank part of the recording sheet.  (You'll need this information later to figure out how high the sun was at noon.)  
1. Record your data.  Throughout the day, mark the tip of the shadow that the gnomon casts with a small dot or x, and note the time of your observation next to it.  If you do this once an hour, you will  see quite dramatic changes in the position of the shadow.  If you are able to mark your points more frequently, do so.  Even every 20-30 minutes you'll see quite noticeable changes.  It would be especially helpful to have a close series of points (say, every 10 or 20 minutes) just before and just after noon.  Since you are all busy people, you may need to get team members or friends to help you collect all the points you want recorded.  (Be sure to record this fact in your notes if you do.)  At the end of the day, the points you have recorded should form a symmetrical curve on the recording sheet.

Bring your annotated shadow plot to class to discuss and turn in.

## Interpreting shadow plots

We'll look together in class at some very simple applications of  a straightedge and drawing compass to  prove a few interesting facts about the sun's daily movement.  Before then, see if you can figure out on your shadow plot:

- Where is the shortest distance between the gnomon and the curve of your shadow plot?  How close is it to the point on your curve you recorded
closest to noon on your watch?
- What was the earliest and latest time of day you recorded an observation?   If you recorded an observation close to sunset, can you tell where the sun was on the horizon?
- What are the greatest distances between the gnomon and the curve of your shadow plot?  What times of day do these points correspond to?
