##  Before coming to class

Review "The Use of the Gnomon" (pp. 27-29 - sections 1.3 - 1.4) from Evans, *Theory and Practice of Ancient Astronomy* (available on Moodle as "evans-gnomon.pdf").

On Moodle, read the longest and most detailed description of Eratosthenes' experiment, written by an astronomer and philosopher named Cleomedes.  Eratosthenes' experiment is the first documented instance  of a Greek scientist applying quantitative measurements to an abstract geometric model.  In reading this short text, look for answers to tthe following questions:



- What assumptions (*hypotheses*) does Eratosthenes make?
- How does Eratosthenes develop his argument from his initial stated assumptions?
- Are there any hints in Cleomedes' account of how Eratosthenes thought about the *precision* of his work?
