## Context



Where does the sun rise and set?  Does it rise and set in the same place every day? Does it pass directly overhead?  How high in the sky does the sun reach?  You can learn all of this and more from a shadow plot.  



##  Before coming to class

Please read "The Use of the Gnomon" (pp. 27-29 - sections 1.3 - 1.4) from Evans, *Theory and Practice of Ancient Astronomy* (available on Moodle as "evans-gnomon.pdf").

Don't worry if you're not familiar with the trigonometry on p. 29. You should be able to explain how a raw shadow plot like figure 1.6 can be used in figure 1.8 to find true north.

What do you think would happen if you repeatedly recorded shadow plots at different times of the year?

## In class

We'll have a short quiz on interpreting shadow plots of the kind illustrated in the reading selection from Evans.
