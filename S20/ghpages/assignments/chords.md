## Chords


The *chord* was the only trigonometric function used in ancient Greek mathematics.  In Ptolemy's *Almagest*, the chord function is the first table that Ptolemy defines.

If you want to review what the *chord* function measurements, see [these notes](https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/djoyce/trig/chords.html), and the beginning of [this page on sines](https://www2.clarku.edu/faculty/djoyce/trig/sines.html), labelled "the Bow and Arrow diagram."


## Greek numeric notation

Review the so-called "Milesian system" of numeric notation, [summarized in this table](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/resources/milesian2.html) (and handed out in class)

- what range of values can you express with this notation?


## Reading numbers in Greek manuscripts
