## Context

A remarkable feature of ancient Greek science is its insistence that this special category of knowledge requires that explanable observations be modelled in ways that can be mathematically proven.

One of the most prominent disciplines illustrating this pattern is astronomy.  In reading for today's class, you will be to the ancient model of the basic astronomical phenomena:  the regular, observable patterns of movement of the fixed stars, wandering stars (the planets), the sun and the moon.



## Before coming to class


- read pages xii-xiii in the preface to Perry-Donahue, *Almagest*, so you understand how to use this book
- read pages 1-7 in Perry-Donahue's *Almagest*
- read pages 15-17 in Perry-Donahue's *Almagest*, and try to determine the answer to these questions:

1. In figure 1 on p. 15, the point *C* represents a fixed star. If you wanted to place it on one of the figures on page 2, which one would be best?
2. In figure 1 on p. 15, the directional arrow below the north Pole *P<sub>N</sub>* shows the rotational direction of the celestial sphere.  If you are a viewer on the earth (*T*) in the northern hemisphere, you will see stars rotating as illustrated in figure *(a)* on p. 2.  If you drew an arrow on any of the illustrated "trails," which way would it point?
