## Context





## Before coming to class
 

- read pages xii-xiii in the preface to Perry-Donahue, *Almagest*, so you understand how to use this book
- read pages 1-7 in Perry-Donahue's *Almagest*
- read pages 15-17 in Perry-Donahue's *Almagest*, and try to determine the answer to these questions:

1. In figure 1 on p. 15, the point *C* represents a fixed star. If you wanted to place it on one of the figures on page 2, which one would be best?
2. In figure 1 on p. 15, the directional arrow below the north Pole *P<sub>N</sub>* shows the rotational direction of the celestial sphere.  If you are a viewer on the earth (*T*) in the northern hemisphere, you will see stars rotating as illustrated in figure *(a)* on p. 2.  If you drew an arrow on any of the illustrated "trails," which way would it point?
