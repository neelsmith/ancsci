title: "Worksheet: Greek geometric proof"

---


The following examples are from perhaps the purest example of Greek mathematical proof, since it appeals to no outside source:  book 1 of Euclid's *Elements of Geometry*.

Before he undertakes the first proof, Euclid defines anything that does not need (or does not admit of) proof.   He organizes these preliminaries into three groups:

1.  **definitions** These define the *elements* proper to the science being discussed.
2.  **postulates**  These define what actions can be carried out with those elements.
3. **common notions** These are ideas that apply not just to geometry or any single subject.


Consider the relation of the following definitions, postulates and common notions.

> ### Definitions:

> (1)  A point is infinitely small.
>
> (2)  A line has length but is infinitely narrow.
>
> ...
>
> (15) A circle is a figure in a plane contained by a single line;  from a center point, every line to the circle is exactly the same length.
>
> ...
>
> (20) Triangles with three equal sides are called equilateral triangles;  triangles with only two equal sides are called isosceles triangles;  triangles with all three sides different lengths are called scalene triangles.
>
> ### Postulates:
>
> (1) It is possible to draw a straight line to connect any two points.

> (2) It is possible to extend a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.

> (3) It is possible to create a circle if you are given a center point and a distance.

> ### Common Notions: ###

> (1) If two things are equal to a third thing, they are equal to each other.

> (2) If you add the same amount to two equal things, the results are also equal.

> (3) If you take the same amount away from two equal things, the results are also equal.


With those preliminaries in hand, Euclid can proceed to prove a proposition.


## Proving Euclid, Proposition 1.1

Euclid states the problem as follows:

> Given a straight line, construct an equilateral triangle on it.


For Proposition 1.1, Euclid relies on:

- Post. 3
- Post. 1
- Def. 15
- C.N. 1

Please:


1. diagram what Euclid describes
1. fill in the blanks below with the correct justification for each step of Euclid's solution


The first part of a Euclidean proof is normally presented as a *construction* that reaches the desired end or solves the problem.


> (1) "Assume we have a finite straight line; label it AB.  We want to construct an equilateral triangle on AB." [What we want to prove.]

> (2) "Using A as the center, and AB as the distance from the
> center , construct a circle; label two further points on the circle C and D."  [________________]

> (3). "Using B as the center, and BA as the distance from the center, construct a circle;  label a further point on the circle E, and label as C the point where the two circles cut one another."  [________________]

> (4). "Connect C and A with a straight line;  connect C and B with a straight line." [________________]




After the construction, Euclid then proves that the construction in fact solves the problem:



> (1). "Since A is the center of circle CDB, AC must be equal to AB."  [________________]


> (2).  "Since B is the center of CAE, BC must be equal to BA."  [________________]


> (3).  "But (in step 1) we proved that CA is equal to AB, so CA and CB are both equal to AB; and two things that are equal to the same thing are equal to each other." [________________]


> (4). "Therefore, the three straight lines CA, AB, BC are equal to one another;  therefore,  the triangle ABC is equilateral." [________________]



At this point, Euclid formulaically states the conclusion:



> This is what we set out to construct.



(This is the formula you may seen abbreviated from its Latin translation, *QEF* -- Quod Erat Faciendum, "what we set out to construct" -- or *QED* -- Quod Erat Demonstrandum, "what we set out to prove.")








## Proving Euclid, Proposition 1.2

The problem:

> Given a straight line, and a point, construct a straight line equal to the given line at the point.


For Proposition 1.2, Euclid uses:


- Post. 1
- Proposition 1.1
- Post. 2
- Post. 3
- C.N. 1
- C.N. 3


The construction:

> 1. "Label the given point A;  label the given straight line BC;  we want to place at point A a straight line equal to the given straight line BC."   [What we want to prove.]
> 2. "Connect A and B with a straight line." [________________]
>  3. "On the line AB, construct an equilateral triangle DAB." [________________]</p>
>  4. "Extend line DA with a line AE;  extend DB with a straight line BF."  [________________]
>  5.  "Using B as the center and BC as the distance from the center, construct a circle CGH;  again, using D as the center and DG as the distance from the center, construct a circle  GKL"  [________________]




Proving that the solution solves the problem:


> 1.  "Since point B is the center of CGH, BC must be equal to BG."  [________________]
> 2.  "Again, since D is th center of GKL, DL must be equal to DG." [________________]
> 3.  "We made DA equal to DB (in constructing an equilateral triangle), so the remainder AL must be euqal to the remainder BG." [________________]
> 4.  "But BC was also proven to be equal to BG;  therefore each of the straight lines AL, BC is equal to BG;  and things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.  Therefore AL is also equal to BC."  
[________________]
> 5.  "Therefore at the given point A, the straight line AL has been constructed equal to the given striaght line BC."
>
> This is what we set out to construct (QEF). </p>
