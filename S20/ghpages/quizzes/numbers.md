You should be able *recognize* in printed form the 27 characters used to write numbers in the "Milesian" notational system.  You can review [material from this assignment](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/science/S20/assignments/chords/), and use the summary sheet handed out in class (online [here](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/resources/milesian.html)).

You should understand how they function in a place-value system without a zero character marking empty columns.

You will be asked to write the numeric equivalent of values written in Milesian notation.
