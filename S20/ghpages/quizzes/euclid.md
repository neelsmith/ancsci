title: "Euclidean proof"
---


You should understand the difference between:

- a *hypothesis* (in the Greek sense: something previously established or accepted)
- a *proposition* (a statement to demonstrate)



In Euclid's introductory hypotheses, you should recognize the differences between:

- definitions
- postulates
- "common notions" (also called *axioms*)


In Euclid's propositions, you should recognize the difference between:

- a *problem*: this is the traditional term for a construction problem.  Its enunciation will define something to prove;  its conclusion should lead to "Exactly what we wanted to construct!" (Q.E.F.)
- a *theorem*: this is a proposition that demonstrates a defined property or relation.  Its enunciation will state that something is true;  its conclusion should lead to "Exactly what we wanted to prove!" (Q.E.D.)

You should be able to recognize in a proof the following three required parts:

- the enunciation (or *statement* of the proof)
- the proof (step-by-step process depending solely on previously established points)
- the conclusion.
