You should understand how a manuscript is assembled, and be comfortable with the *highlighted* technical terms.


### Materials

  - *parchment*: animal skin prepared for use as writing material.  See this [video from the Getty museum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuNfdHNTv9o).  (But note that the some of the details on illumination are not relevant for the manuscripts we are studying.)
- for many of the manuscripts we are studying, a single sheep might be large enough to produce two *bifolios* (see below).  Think about how many sheep would be needed to produce a full manuscript of a work like the *Almagest*!


### Organization of a manuscript


- *codex*: a book-format manuscript
- *bifiolio* : a single sheet of parchment
- *folio* : a single physical leaf when a bifolio is folded in half;  folding a bifolio creates two folios
- page:  one side of a folio.  The front (the first one you would read in a manuscript) is called the *recto*; the back is called the *verso*.
- pages are typically identified by folio number + *recto* or *verso*.
- *quire* or *gather*: a group of bifolios stacked together like pages in a section of a newspaper.  
- *quaternion*:  a quire consisting of four bifolios.  (This is a very common size for quires in early manuscripts of Greek scientific texts.)  Four bifolios = 8 folios = 16 pages.
- Note that if the folios are numbered consecutively, the first bifolio in a quaternion will contain folios 1 and 8; the second will contain folios 2 and 7; the third will contain folios 3 and 6. The fourth and innermost bifolio contains folios 4 and 5, and is the only one of the four bifolios with consecutive folios.


## The copying process

- Copying must be done quire by quire.  (Think about the way pages are ordered in a quire if you're not sure why!)
- Quires are typically numbered (either on the front of the first page or back of the last page).  This is so a completed quire can be set aside, and the whole manuscript easily assembled in the correct order for binding.
- The page layout is defined by ruled lines applied before any ink is added. (See the Getty video linked above.)
- Textual content is added first, and space for mathematical figures is set aside for subsequent adding.  (How can we know this?)
- On some occasions (but not normally), scribes included a *colophon* at the end: a sort of "title page" with the name of the scribe and other information.
- Because parchment was expensive, pages could sometimes be reused.  A *palimpsest* is a manuscript where the original text's ink is scraped away, and the parchment reused for a different text.

## Transmission and survival: Euclid vs. Archimedes


### Euclid, *ELements of Geometry*

Two key MSS show different pths of transmissioN:

- D'Orville 301:  the earliest surviving MS of a complete classical work is a manuscript of Euclid's *Geometry* dated by a colophon to 888 CE ().  Think about the gap in time between that MS and Euclid's date of composition!
    - includes notes by Arethas of Patrae (Bishop of Caesarea from 902 â€“ c. 939)
    - and further notes from 10th-14th centuries.  This text was used!
- Vatican 190:
  - 10th c?
  - text differs from "standard" Euclid
  - proof matching text in Theon's commentary.

Other evidence for wide use:

- multiple commentaries
- *scholia*
- more than 180 MSS in Greek!
- translations in Arabic, Latin

### Archimedes


All our knowledge of Archimedes comes from three 10th-century sources:

- **A**: known only from Latin translation!
- **B**: lost by 16th century, known from copies
- **C**: the Archimedes palimpsest: overwritten by 13th century prayer book
