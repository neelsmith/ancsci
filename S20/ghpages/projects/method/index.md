The originally scheduled group exercises were intended in part to expose you to a range of valid approaches to studying primary source evidence:  experimental replication of an ancient scientific process described in a primary source text (although we only partially completed the experiment to replicate Eratosthenes' measurement of the earth's circumference before we left campus), interpreting data from an ancient source (Ptolemy's *Geography*), and working with a scientific manuscript.

Other approaches to primary-source evidence are also possible.  Once we have a defined topic, I can help you define methods appropriate to the sources for your topic.
