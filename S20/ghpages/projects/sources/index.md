Once we have agreed on a topic, I can help you find appropriate sources.  We are constrained by the kinds of material that survive and the kinds of material that are accessible to us.  

For example, Autolycus of Pitane wrote two surviving astronomical treatises.  He was contemporary with or perhaps a little earlier than Euclid -- that would make him our earliest surviving scientific text!  But he has never been translated into English, so his work is not a good choice for you to work from.

It is unlikely but not impossible that you will be able to work with publications of primary archaeological material. More frequently, we will work with surviving primary texts available to us in translation, or with manuscripts of scientific texts.
