Oral presentation to your classmates in a Holy Cross classroom will not be possible this semester.  How should you submit your work?

The only requirement is that your submission should present your research to a non-specialist audience.  If you complete this project, you should have something you can proudly show to a friend or family member.

Think creatively!  I'm open to suggestions.  Some possiblities:

- a web site
- a slide show with voice-over
- a pod cast
- a video
- other??

At the end of this stage of the project, we'll define a format that will be due in a complete draft on Apr. 30.
