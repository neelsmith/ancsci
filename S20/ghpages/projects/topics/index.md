> Topics for self-designed projects define a limited, open research question that you can address from *primary sources*.


You might wish to extend the work you did on one of the group exercises in some way, or you might have other ideas about topics you would like to explore.  For a topic to be approved, it must:

- pose a question you can answer from primary sources.  Topics that report on secondary scholarship or require extensive coverage of secondary sources will not be accepted.
- be possible to answer from available primary sources. 
- be reasonable to complete by the final due date (May 6)


I can help you try to find a suitable topic.  Start with *something* you're interested in - a kind of question, a particular source - and I can meet with you to talk through possibilities.

A work like Ptolemy's *Almagest*, for example, is so massive that there are endless possible ways to study some part of the work.  Our group exercise with manuscripts will focus on interpreting a table of ascensions (or rising times), but he has fascinating material giving instructions for building the different machines and devices he uses, for example, and records many observations by other astronomers.  

In addition, online images of manuscripts open up many topics that have never been explored before. How did the manuscript function as a scientific text?  You might want to study the diagrams and figures in a text like Archimedes' *On Floating Bodies*, for example.

Once your topic has been approved, **you may find you need to modify it** as you begin to work with your sources.  This is probably a sign of progress!  Just clear it with me as you go along.
