## Reading

Our reading will focus primarily on *primary sources*.  Daily assignments are linked from the [online course schedule](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/science/S20/schedule/). Note that linked reading should be completed *before* the class meeting the assignment is linked from.  

Some online readings will be directly linked from the assignment page; others will be explicitly identified as available on Moodle.  In addition, the following text book is on order in the College Book Store:
