## Overview of assignment

Each team is assigned approximately 30 points from Ptolemy's *Geography*.


The sites assigned to your group are available for [download here](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/science/S20/ptolemy-assignments/) in two formats: as a .kml file that you can view in Google Earth or Google Maps, and as a simple comma-delimited text file (.csv) that you can import directly as a Spreadsheet or a Table in Google documents.

You will search for each item in Ptolemy’s inventory in the inventory of sites at [pleiades.stoa.org](https://pleiades.stoa.org/). You may need to be creative in trying alternate spellings of ancient place names. If you strike out searching for a Greek name transcribed as “Surakousai”, try a more Latinate form like “Syracuse,” for example.  Here are some notes about [transcription of Greek names](transcriptions/).

## Submitting your data

Each team will create a Google spreadsheet with three columns:

1. a unique identifier
1. a name or label for the site
2. a third column where you should enter either the Pleiades identifier number, or the single letter ‘x’ if you could not find an identifier.


Make sure your spreadsheet is publicly visible and email me a linke to it when it is ready for review.


## Specifications for grading

Format:

- Three-column table
- Values in the first two columns are unchanged from the data set your team was assigned
- Values in the third column are either a Pleiades ID number (typically 6 digits) or the single letter 'x'

Content:

- 90% or higher acceptance rate

I will evaluate your sites in two groups.  For all sites with Pleiades IDs, I will plot them and see if there are any obvious outliers or errors.  For sites with no Pleiades ID, I will also search Pleiades for a matching site.  If I agree with your entry in the third column (that is, I agree either that the Pleiades ID you supply looks reasonable, or I agree that we can't find a matching Pleiades site) for 90% of more of your sites, your sumbission wiill be graded satisfactory.  If the acceptance is below 90%, it will be grade unsatisfactory.
