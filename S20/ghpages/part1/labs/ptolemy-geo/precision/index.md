## Overview of assignment

Is Ptolemy's nominal precision affected by the density of sites in a region?

You will compare the region you examined with your assigned 30 sites to the global data set.

## Submission

A brief analysis of no more than 300 words discussing  how your precision and density for your region compare to global patterns in Ptolemy's data set.

> TBA:  this page will be updated with a link to the global data measures and density measures for your region


## Specifications for grading

Your discussion should indicate:

- how many sites could you identify in Pleiades? how many were not recognized?
- what is the maximum precision value for your region (that is, the smallest fractional value for longitude/latitude figures)?
- how do precision values for your region compare to global precision in Ptolemy?
- how do
