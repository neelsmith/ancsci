title: "Recording a shadow plot"

Before attempting to replicate Eratosthenes' experiment, your team should get some practice recording a shadow plot.

Review what you know about interpreting a shadow plot, and organize your team to record a single day record.  Issues you'll need to consider:

- location
- how to determine if the recording surface is level
- how to set up a pointer (*gnomon*), and find its perpendicular height
- time intervals for observations:  you should have some observations early enough in the morning and late enough in the afternoon to see the shape of the plot accurately.  Near local (sun-time) noon, your points will fall closer to each other: you may be able to record them a little less frequently

## Process

- mark where your shadow falls at given points through the day with an X or clear mark on your recording surface.  Adjacent to it, write the time (nearest minute in modern, clock time)

## Question to answer

- What time of day (clock time) did local noon (sun time) occur?


Bring your completed shadow plot to class.
