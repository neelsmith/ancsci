title:  "Interpreting your edition"
layout: page
---


## Background

You have created a translation of a *diplomatic edition* of your assigned section of a Greek manuscript:  that is, you have transcribed exactly what you read, and not attempted to correct or restore a hypothesized or reconstructed reading.  By contrast, editors of print editions often publish *critical editions*.  This means that they attempt to reconstruct a no-longer extant version of the text.  (It is worth reflecting on the fact that the one thing you can be certain of concerning a critical edition is that it appears in no extant source.)

What can we learn by working with a diplomatic edition?

## Submission


Each team should submit a brief analysis of no more than 300 words comparing your edition to an English translation of a standard critical edition.

## Specifications for grading

Your discussion should compare your edition to the corresponding English translation in Bruce Perry's translation of the *Almagest*.  Your discussion should:


- identify any differences in the readings you edited and the values that Perry prints
- analyze whether those differences represent a consistent pattern, or are more easily explained as isolated copying errors
- consider the significance of the differences.  Do the  distinctive features of your manuscript teach us anything about how the manuscript was copied or used?
