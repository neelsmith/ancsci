## Overview of assignment

Is Ptolemy's nominal precision affected by the density of sites in a region?

You will compare the region you examined with your assigned 30 sites to the global data set.


## Steps to follow


1. Be sure you know what *province* your data set falls in.  You can download and open the `kml` file of points assigned to your group in Google Earth, and compare it to the [colored and labelled provinces in this map](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/science/S20/data/ptolemy-provinces.kml) (again, a `.kml` file you can download and open in Google Earth).
2. Consult the [table of data breaking down density of sites for each province, and maximum precision in longitude and latitude for each province](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/science/S20/data/provinces-valid-geo-density-precision.csv).

## Submission

Each team should submit a brief analysis of no more than 300 words discussing  how the precision and density for your region compare to global patterns in Ptolemy's data set.



## Specifications for grading

Your discussion should indicate:

- how many sites could you identify in Pleiades? how many were not recognized?
- what is the maximum precision value for your region (that is, the smallest fractional value for longitude/latitude figures)?
- how do precision values for your region compare to global precision in Ptolemy?
